CMSC 23 Removals

Create a chess game for 2 players.
Game process:
- A player must make a move then press a button to signal the next player's turn
- The board must switch on each player's turn 
	on player 1's turn, his pieces are on the bottom of the board
	on player 2's turn, his pieces are also on the bottom of the board
- The game must provide functions like castling and promotion
- There must be a message when a "check" happens
- The game ends when a king is killed (no need to check for check mate)
- There must be a new game and exit function
